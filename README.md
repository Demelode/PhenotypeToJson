PhenotypeToJson
===============

Converting a flat file which contains phenotype data to a JSON structure.

Instructions

You'll need to install jsonpickle by following the instructions here: http://jsonpickle.github.io/#download-install

If you're using a Linux distro, use the pip install, and if you are on a OSX varient, you'll need to clone the jsonpickle repo and manually install.

A lot of the potential data points are commented out to compress the final json file. Uncomment the sections you want to generate as needed.
